# CustomCleaner
File cleaner by extension
---------------------------

**CustomCleaner** is a lightweight utility designed to automate folder decluttering.
It allows users to target and batch-delete specific file types (e.g., .tmp, .log, .jpg) within a directory and all its subfolders.
For added safety, the program moves files to the recycle bin instead of deleting them permanently.
It is the perfect tool for quickly purging digital clutter and reclaiming storage space.
